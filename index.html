    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Hello!!! My name is Natalie, based in Seattle, though most people on the internet call me Himi. Why Himi? Well, for the last 4 years, my handles on all my social media and gamer tags have been "Himouto Life" (or some variation of that), which is based off the anime "Himouto! Umaru-Chan". One day when streaming, a community member thought it was a mouthful to say, so they shorted it to Himi-Chan, which in turn got shortened to just Himi.</p>

  <h2> About Me!!</h2>
  <div>
  
    <p> I am a software developer, with a passion for game design. I love video games so much that I want to fully immerse myself in them 24/7 (just kidding, I have to sleep and eat sometime, right? RIGHT?!).</p>
    <p>I stream on Twitch in my freetime, to which my community is called "The Pantry". I tend to play mmo's and pvp type games. But I do occassionally play single player games with a start and definitive finish. </p>
